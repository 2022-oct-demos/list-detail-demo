# Plan

### HTML
- on home page
    - div to hold list of items
    - render each item once its fetched from supabase (not hard coded)
- on detail page
    - section and div container for details
    - in header, link to home page

### Events

- home page LOAD
    - fetch all of the items from supabase
    - DISPLAY all items
        - loop through, render, and append to container
- detail page LOAD
    - fetch single item from supabase (by id)
    - render to page based on item's info
    + use URLSearchParams to get the item's id

### Functions
- fetch-utils -> getItem, getItemById
- render-utils -> renderItemCard, renderItemDetail

### Slices
1. get all items to render to home page on load
2. make item cards clickable & redirect to detail page
3. get detail page to render with appropriate details (hard coded id)
4. use URLSearchParams to fill in id dynamically
